API:
    Notes
    - Read the documentation and tested the API endpoints utilizing Postman.
    - Added a test gateway, added a few payment_methods and users. 
        - For some reason the POST requests sent with a token were not processing (Json and XML)
        - Purchase POST requests passing the card with it, only returned with (status=Falied) and only worked using XML not Json.
        I didnâ€™t look further if it was the currency or something like that.

    - Creating a test gayway through postman it only worked when the post request was sent in XML format.

CUSTOMERS WORRIES
	International
Set strategy of the user experience when going international, from the UI design perspective to accommodate particular requirements from local payment gateways. Such as 3DS 2.0. Look into regulatory barriers at the very beginning is important.

HOW THE PRODUCT WORKS
    - How do spreedly charge a recurring subscription on Stripe? Does it support subscriptions? if they don't manage subscriptions how
      hard if for clints to manage ongoing subscription in multiple platforms? Is there another Saas company that acts as a subscription
      middle-were and that helps manage all the subscription in one single place?
    - Spreedly offers a logic of smartly rounting payments with focus on approval rate.
        - How can we build a transaction routing logic that saves time and enhance the gains for the clients?
    What are the functionalities of the APIs?

Onboarding
    - onboarding and testing process could be more intuitive?
    - Documentation is a bit confusing. I should be clear what every step should be.
    - How long it takes to get up and running
    - Design and navigation
