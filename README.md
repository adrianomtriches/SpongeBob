**Git commands**

- To work in other projects: -> click in fork, add the project to your account. Get the link of the repo. then on the terminal use the command "git clone <repolink>"
- Git status "red === changes were made but not added" - "green === changes were added"
- Git add <name of the file> or just, git add . “With a space and a dot to select all files that you made changes to it”
- Git Status “status should’ve changed to green”
- Git commit -m “add your msg here, changes you made”
- Git push “pushes the code into GitHub”
- Git pull “updates to the most current changes on the document”

- Git checkout -b <name of the branch> “Creates a new Branch and switches to the branch”
- Git branch <name of the branch> “creates a new branch but doesn’t switches to it”.
- Git checkout <name of the branch> “switches to the branch”
- Git diff “shows the changes you made”

Good practice:
- Before merging code from a branch into the master branch it’s good to switch to the master branch and do a pull after you have added and committed, just to make sure you don’t get any conflicts on the code.
- Than switching back to the branch and “git merge master” into the branch to visually see any conflicts in the code, in the text editor.
